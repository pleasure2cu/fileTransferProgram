##### the server program needs a folder named 'sharedData' in the same place as the python script is. This folder will be the place where the data, which is visible to the clients, will be stored.


##### the client can use 3 commands:
##### 1. download *name*            (where name is the full name (incl. type) of a file on the server)
##### 2. upload *path*              (where path is the full path to the file the client wants to upload)
##### 3. quit (which will exit the program)

##### NOTE: the source code of the server program and of the client program has to be changed so that the correct IPv4-addresses and ports are used
